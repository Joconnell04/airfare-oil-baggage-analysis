    "# CS2316 Final Project — Phase II  \n",
    "### Data Collection, Cleaning, Standardization, and Merge Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, the objective is to implement an end-to-end ETL pipeline for the three required datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Downloaded dataset** — DOT Consumer Airfare Report (Table 1A CSV)  \n",
    "2) **HTML-sourced dataset** — BTS Baggage Fee revenues (web-scraped or link-extracted Excel)  \n",
    "3) **API/JSON dataset** — EIA WTI crude oil prices (via REST API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, an optional **FRED CPI JSON dataset** will be used for inflation normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tasks for Phase II include:\n",
    "- Programmatically retrieving all required datasets (read/download/API/scrape)\n",
    "- Parsing into DataFrames\n",
    "- Cleaning and standardizing fields (date alignment to quarters, carrier naming, currency inflation-adjustment)\n",
    "- Creating at least 3–5 documented inconsistencies and resolving them in-code\n",
    "- Exporting all cleaned datasets to new files\n",
    "- Returning the cleaned DataFrames in the notebook\n",
    "- Preparing the merged structure so Phase III analysis can be done immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "Deliverable is a fully executed Jupyter notebook showing function-based ETL for each dataset, with cleaned exports and documented inconsistencies visible in the output.\n",
    "\n",
